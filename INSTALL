To use "aaaa-check.py", you need to have "dnspython" installed.  You can obtain
the latest version from:

  http://www.dnspython.org/
  
Click on the link for "Python 2.x Stable" and choose the appropriate .zip or
.tar.gz file. [1]

Once you have unzipped/untarred dnspython, cd into that directory and type:

    python setup.py install
    
With dnspython installed, you now should just be able to go into the directory
for aaaa-check and type:

    python aaaa-check.py
    
The program runs in an infinite loop until you press Ctrl+C to terminate it.
